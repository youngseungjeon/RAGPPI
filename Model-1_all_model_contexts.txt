Please answer based on the length and format of the provided example.

Abstract:
Otx3/Dmbx1 is a member of paired class homeodomain transcription factors. In this study, we found that Otx3/Dmbx1 represses the Otx2-mediated transactivation by forming heterodimer with Otx2 on the P3C (TAATCCGATTA) sequence in vitro. The 156 amino acid region (residues 1-156) of Otx3/Dmbx1 is required for its repressor activity, and interacts directly with Otx2. Co-localization of Otx3/Dmbx1 and Otx2 in brain sections was confirmed by in situ hybridization. These data suggest that Otx3/Dmbx1 represses Otx2-mediated transcription in the developing brain. We also identified the consensus binding sequence [TAATCCGATTA and TAATCC(N2-4)TAATCC] of Otx3/Dmbx1.

Answer:
Otx3/Dmbx1 forms a heterodimer with Otx2, inhibiting Otx2-mediated transactivation on the P3C sequence. This interaction is facilitated by the 156 amino acid region of Otx3/Dmbx1, which is required for its repressor activity. The result is a repression of Otx2-mediated transcription in the developing brain, suggesting a regulatory role for Otx3/Dmbx1 in brain development.

Example: TRIP12>TAF10


According to the abstract, what biological, functional, or physical effects result from TRIP12>TAF10?
Please answer based on the length and format of the provided example.

Abstract:
Background:The MYC oncoprotein, also known as the master regulator of genes, is a transcription factor that regulates numerous physiological processes, including cell cycle control, apoptosis, protein synthesis and cell adhesion, among others. MYC is overexpressed in approximately 70% of human cancers. Given its pervasive role in cancer biology, MYC down-regulation has become an attractive cancer treatment strategy.Methods:The CRISPR/Cas9 method was used to produce KO cell models. Western blot was used to analyzed the expressions of MYC and TATA-binding proteinassociated factors 10 (TAF10) in cancer cells (MCF7, A549, HepG2 cells) Cell culture studies were performed to determine the mechanisms by which small molecules (Z363119456, Z363) affects MYC and TAF10 expressions and functions. Mouse studies were carried out to investigate the impact of Z363 regulation on tumor growth.Results:Z363 activate Thyroid hormone Receptor-interacting Protein 12 (TRIP12), which phosphorylates MYC at Thr58, resulting in MYC ubiquitination and degradation and thereby regulating MYC target genes. Importantly, TRIP12 also induces TAF10 degradation, which reduces MYC protein levels. TRIP12, an E3 ligase, controls MYC levels both directly and indirectly by inhibiting MYC or TAF10 activity.Conclusions:In summary,these results demonstrate the anti-cancer properties of Z363, a small molecule that is co-regulated by TAF10 and MYC.

Answer:
The activation of TRIP12 by Z363 leads to the phosphorylation of MYC at Thr58, which triggers its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation, thereby regulating MYC target genes. Concurrently, TRIP12 also induces the degradation of TAF10, which further reduces MYC protein levels. This dual action of TRIP12, both directly and indirectly, controls MYC levels and inhibits its activity, demonstrating the potential anti-cancer properties of Z363.

Example: OTULIN>SNX27


According to the abstract, what biological, functional, or physical effects result from OTULIN>SNX27?
Please answer based on the length and format of the provided example.

Abstract:
OTULIN (OTU Deubiquitinase With Linear Linkage Specificity) specifically hydrolyzes methionine1 (Met1)-linked ubiquitin chains conjugated by LUBAC (linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex). Here we report on the mass spectrometric identification of the OTULIN interactor SNX27 (sorting nexin 27), an adaptor of the endosomal retromer complex responsible for protein recycling to the cell surface. The C-terminal PDZ-binding motif (PDZbm) in OTULIN associates with the cargo-binding site in the PDZ domain of SNX27. By solving the structure of the OTU domain in complex with the PDZ domain, we demonstrate that a second interface contributes to the selective, high affinity interaction of OTULIN and SNX27. SNX27 does not affect OTULIN catalytic activity, OTULIN-LUBAC binding or Met1-linked ubiquitin chain homeostasis. However, via association, OTULIN antagonizes SNX27-dependent cargo loading, binding of SNX27 to the VPS26A-retromer subunit and endosome-to-plasma membrane trafficking. Thus, we define an additional, non-catalytic function of OTULIN in the regulation of SNX27-retromer assembly and recycling to the cell surface.

Answer:
OTULIN binds to SNX27 via its C-terminal PDZ-binding motif, associating with the cargo-binding site in the PDZ domain of SNX27. This interaction does not affect OTULIN's catalytic activity, its binding to LUBAC, or Met1-linked ubiquitin chain homeostasis. However, it does inhibit SNX27-dependent cargo loading, binding of SNX27 to the VPS26A-retromer subunit, and endosome-to-plasma membrane trafficking, thereby regulating SNX27-retromer assembly and recycling to the cell surface.

Please answer based on the length and format of the provided example.

Abstract:
A novel coronavirus [severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)] outbreak has caused a global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, resulting in tens of thousands of infections and thousands of deaths worldwide. The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [(RdRp), also named nsp12] is the central component of coronaviral replication and transcription machinery, and it appears to be a primary target for the antiviral drug remdesivir. We report the cryo-electron microscopy structure of COVID-19 virus full-length nsp12 in complex with cofactors nsp7 and nsp8 at 2.9-angstrom resolution. In addition to the conserved architecture of the polymerase core of the viral polymerase family, nsp12 possesses a newly identified √Ö¬í√¢¬â¬§-hairpin domain at its N terminus. A comparative analysis model shows how remdesivir binds to this polymerase. The structure provides a basis for the design of new antiviral therapeutics that target viral RdRp.

Answer:
The interaction between nsp12 and nsp8 forms the central component of the coronaviral replication and transcription machinery. This complex is the primary target of the antiviral drug remdesivir. The binding of remdesivir to this complex inhibits the replication of the virus, providing a potential therapeutic effect for COVID-19.

Example: env>CD4


According to the abstract, what biological, functional, or physical effects result from env>CD4?
Please answer based on the length and format of the provided example.

Abstract:
The binding region for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and epitopes for a panel of HIV-blocking anti-CD4 monoclonal antibodies of the CD4 molecule were defined by using in vitro site-directed mutagenesis. Codons for two amino acid residues (Ser-Arg) were inserted at selected positions within the region encoding the first and second immunoglobulin-like domains of CD4. A vaccinia virus-based expression system was used to produce soluble full-length extracellular CD4 fragments containing the insertions. The mutant proteins were tested for direct binding to soluble gp120 (the CD4-binding subunit of the viral envelope glycoprotein) and to a series of HIV-blocking anti-CD4 monoclonal antibodies. Impaired gp120 binding activity resulted from insertions after amino acid residues 31, 44, 48, 52, 55, and 57 in the first immunoglobulin-like domain. The epitopes for two HIV-blocking monoclonal antibodies, OKT4A and OKT4D, were also mapped in the gp120-binding region in the first domain. Insertions after amino acid residues 21 and 91 in the first domain had no effect on gp120 binding but impaired the binding of OKT4E, suggesting that this antibody recognizes a discontinuous epitope not directly involved in gp120 binding. Moderate impairment of gp120 binding resulted from the insertion after amino acid residues 164 in the second immunoglobulin-like domain, where the epitopes for monoclonal antibodies MT151 and OKT4B were also mapped.

Answer:
The interaction between the HIV envelope glycoprotein (gp120) and the CD4 molecule on human cells is crucial for viral entry. Mutations in specific residues of the CD4 molecule impair this binding, potentially preventing HIV infection. Additionally, these mutations can affect the binding of HIV-blocking antibodies, suggesting that these sites could be targeted for therapeutic intervention.

Please answer based on the length and format of the provided example.

Abstract:
Mitotic cyclins in association with the Cdk1 protein kinase regulate progression through mitosis in all eukaryotes. Here, we address to what extent mitotic cyclins in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans provide overlapping functions or distinct biological activities. C. elegans expresses a single A-type cyclin (CYA-1), three typical B-type cyclins (CYB-1, CYB-2.1 and CYB-2.2), and one B3-subfamily member (CYB-3). While we observed clear redundancies between the cyb genes, cyb-1 and cyb-3 also contribute specific essential functions in meiosis and mitosis. CYB-1 and CYB-3 show similar temporal and spatial expression, both cyclins localize prominently to the nucleus, and both associate with CDK-1 and display histone H1 kinase activity in vitro. We demonstrate that inhibition of cyb-1 by RNAi interferes with chromosome congression and causes aneuploidy. In contrast, cyb-3(RNAi) embryos fail to initiate sister chromatid separation. Inhibition of both cyclins simultaneously results in a much earlier and more dramatic arrest. However, only the combination of cyb-1, cyb-3 and cyb-2.1/cyb-2.2 RNAi fully resembles cdk-1 inhibition. This combination of redundant and specific phenotypes supports that in vivo phosphorylation of certain Cdk targets can be achieved by multiple Cdk1/cyclin complexes, while phosphorylation of other targets requires a unique Cdk1/cyclin combination.

Answer:
CYB-1 and CYB-3 cyclins bind to and activate CDK-1, a protein kinase, which in turn phosphorylates various targets to regulate mitosis. Inhibition of CYB-1 disrupts chromosome congression, leading to aneuploidy, while inhibition of CYB-3 prevents initiation of sister chromatid separation. Simultaneous inhibition of both cyclins results in a more severe arrest, indicating that these cyclins have both overlapping and distinct roles in mitotic progression.
