Abstract:
We have isolated a cold-sensitive mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae in which the first step of mRNA splicing is inhibited. The growth and splicing defects are recessive and cosegregate, thus defining a single essential gene (PRP28). The wild-type PRP28 gene was cloned, and sequence analysis reveals extensive homology to a family of proteins that are thought to function as ATP-dependent RNA helicases. The cold sensitivity is caused by a glycine-to-glutamic acid change in a conserved sequence motif. Interestingly, double mutants containing conditional alleles of PRP28 and PRP24, which encodes a U6 snRNA-binding protein, are inviable. In addition, a suppressor of prp28-1 is a mutant allele of PRP8, which encodes a U5 protein, thus linking PRP28 with U5. These data are consistent with a scenario in which PRP28 acts to unwind the U4/U6 base-pairing interaction in the U4/U6/U5 snRNP, facilitating the first covalent step of splicing.

Ground Truth (GT):
PRP28, an ATP-dependent RNA helicase, functionally interacts with PRP24, a U6 snRNA-binding protein, during early steps of pre-mRNA splicing in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. PRP28 facilitates the unwinding of the U4/U6 base-pairing within the U4/U6/U5 tri-snRNP, a critical transition that enables the first catalytic step of splicing. The inviability of double mutants carrying conditional alleles of PRP28 and PRP24 suggests that both proteins act in a coordinated manner to ensure proper spliceosome activation. Mutations in PRP28 disrupt this process, leading to defects in splicing and impaired cell growth.

Answer:
The PRP28 protein, which has homology to ATP-dependent RNA helicases, interacts with the PRP24 protein, a U6 snRNA-binding protein. This interaction facilitates the unwinding of the U4/U6 base-pairing interaction in the U4/U6/U5 snRNP, which is a crucial step in mRNA splicing. Mutations in PRP28 can lead to defects in mRNA splicing and cell growth, highlighting the importance of this interaction in cellular function.

Abstract:
Histone methyltransferases and demethylases reversibly modulate histone lysine methylation, which is considered a key epigenetic mark associated with gene regulation. Recently, aberrant regulation of gene expression by histone methylation modifiers has emerged as an important mechanism for tumorigenesis. However, it remains largely unknown how histone methyltransferases and demethylases coregulate transcriptional profiles for cancer cell characteristics. Here, we show that in breast cancer cells, the histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) demethylase UTX (also known as KDM6A) positively regulates gene expression programs associated with cell proliferation and invasion. The majority of UTX-controlled genes, including a cohort of oncogenes and prometastatic genes, are coregulated by the H3K4 methyltransferase mixed lineage leukemia 4 (MLL4, also called ALR, KMT2D, and MLL2). UTX interacted with a C-terminal region of MLL4. UTX knockdown resulted in significant decreases in the proliferation and invasiveness of breast cancer cells in vitro and in a mouse xenograft model. Such defective cellular characteristics of UTX-depleted cells were phenocopied by MLL4 knockdown cells. UTX-catalyzed demethylation of trimethylated H3K27 and MLL4-mediated trimethylation at H3K4 occurred interdependently at cotarget genes of UTX and MLL4. Clinically, high levels of UTX or MLL4 were associated with poor prognosis in patients with breast cancer. Taken together, these findings uncover that coordinated regulation of gene expression programs by a histone methyltransferase and a histone demethylase is coupled to the proliferation and invasion of breast cancer cells.

Ground Truth (GT):
The histone H3K27 demethylase UTX (KDM6A) and the H3K4 methyltransferase MLL4 (KMT2D) physically interact and co-regulate gene expression programs that promote cell proliferation and invasion in breast cancer cells. At shared target genes, UTX removes repressive H3K27me3 marks while MLL4 deposits activating H3K4me3 marks, enabling coordinated chromatin remodeling. Knockdown of either factor reduces tumor aggressiveness, and high expression levels of UTX or MLL4 correlate with poor clinical outcomes, indicating that their functional interaction represents a potential therapeutic target in breast cancer.

Answer:
The histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) demethylase UTX (KDM6A) and the H3K4 methyltransferase MLL4 (KMT2D) interact and co-regulate gene expression programs associated with cell proliferation and invasion in breast cancer cells. This interaction results in the demethylation of trimethylated H3K27 by UTX and the trimethylation of H3K4 by MLL4 at co-target genes. High levels of UTX or MLL4 are associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer patients, suggesting that this interaction could be a potential therapeutic target.

Abstract:
Previous work has identified a group of genes whose products play important roles in two seemingly unrelated processes: cell cycle progression and splicing. The products of these genes show a network of physical and genetic interactions suggestive of the existence of a protein complex, the cell cycle and splicing complex (CSC). Here we analyze the genetic interactions between ISY1, SYF2 and NTC20, three non-essential components of the CSC. We show that mutations in ISY1 cause lethality in the absence of Ntc20p, and that the double mutant isy1Delta syf2Delta shows a temperature-dependent cell cycle arrest. This arrest is due to lower levels of alpha-tubulin, a protein encoded by TUB1 and TUB3, two intron-containing genes. We show that the low levels of alpha-tubulin in isy1Delta syf2Delta trigger activation of the spindle checkpoint, causing cell cycle arrest. Thus, our results have uncovered an unexpected role for pre-mRNA splicing in the maintenance of the fidelity of chromosome transmission during cell division.

Ground Truth (GT):
ISY1 and NTC20 cooperate within the CSC to support pre-mRNA splicing and maintain proper cell cycle progression. When both are impaired (ISY1 mutation and NTC20 deletion), cells are inviable√¢¬Ä¬îdemonstrating that they have overlapping or compensatory functions critical for survival, especially in the processing of intron-containing genes like TUB1 and TUB3, which are essential for mitotic spindle integrity.

Answer:
Mutations in ISY1 cause lethality when Ntc20p is absent, indicating a critical interaction between these proteins for cell survival. The double mutation of isy1Delta and syf2Delta results in a temperature-dependent cell cycle arrest due to decreased levels of alpha-tubulin, a protein crucial for cell division. This suggests that the ISY1 and NTC20 interaction plays a key role in pre-mRNA splicing, which is essential for maintaining the fidelity of chromosome transmission during cell division.

Abstract:
Since copper (Cu) is essential in key physiological oxidation reactions, organisms have developed strategies for handling Cu while avoiding its potentially toxic effects. Among the tools that have evolved to cope with Cu is a network of Cu homeostasis factors such as Cu-transporting P-type ATPases that play a key role in transmembrane Cu transport. In this work we present the functional characterization of an Arabidopsis Cu-transporting P-type ATPase, denoted heavy metal ATPase 5 (HMA5), and its interaction with Arabidopsis metallochaperones. HMA5 is primarily expressed in roots, and is strongly and specifically induced by Cu in whole plants. We have identified and characterized plants carrying two independent T-DNA insertion alleles, hma5-1 and hma5-2. Both mutants are hypersensitive to Cu but not to other metals such as iron, zinc or cadmium. Interestingly, root tips from Cu-treated hma5 mutants exhibit a wave-like phenotype at early stages and later on main root growth completely arrests whereas lateral roots emerge near the crown. Accordingly, these lines accumulate Cu in roots to a greater extent than wild-type plants under Cu excess. Finally, yeast two-hybrid experiments demonstrate that the metal-binding domains of HMA5 interact with Arabidopsis ATX1-like Cu chaperones, and suggest a regulatory role for the plant-specific domain of the CCH Cu chaperone. Based on these findings, we propose a role for HMA5 in Cu compartmentalization and detoxification.

Ground Truth (GT):
The metal-binding domains of HMA5 interact with Arabidopsis ATX1-like Cu chaperones, and suggest a regulatory role for the plant-specific domain of the CCH Cu chaperone. This interaction helps HMA5 in Cu compartmentalization and detoxification.

Answer:
The interaction between HMA5 and CCH in Arabidopsis plants aids in the regulation of copper (Cu) levels. HMA5, a Cu-transporting P-type ATPase, binds with the CCH Cu chaperone, facilitating the transmembrane transport of Cu. This interaction helps in Cu compartmentalization and detoxification, preventing Cu toxicity and maintaining the plant's health.

Abstract:
Background:Glioblastoma (GBM) remains one of the least successfully treated cancers. It is essential to understand the basic biology of this lethal disease and investigate novel pharmacological targets to treat GBM. The aims of this study were to determine the biological consequences of elevated expression of √Ö¬í√É¬ÆNp73, an N-terminal truncated isoform of TP73, and to evaluate targeting of its downstream mediators, the angiopoietin 1 (ANGPT1)/tunica interna endothelial cell kinase 2 (Tie2) axis, by using a highly potent, orally available small-molecule inhibitor (rebastinib) in GBM.Methods:√Ö¬í√É¬ÆNp73 expression was assessed in glioma sphere cultures, xenograft glioblastoma tumors, and glioblastoma patients by western blot, quantitative reverse transcription PCR, and immunohistochemistry. Immunoprecipitation, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChiP) and sequential ChIP were performed to determine the interaction between √Ö¬í√É¬ÆNp73 and E26 transformation-specific (ETS) proto-oncogene 2 (ETS2) proteins. The oncogenic consequences of √Ö¬í√É¬ÆNp73 expression in glioblastomas were examined by in vitro and in vivo experiments, including orthotopic zebrafish and mouse intracranial-injection models. Effects of rebastinib on growth of established tumors and survival were examined in an intracranial-injection mouse model.Results:√Ö¬í√É¬ÆNp73 upregulates both ANGPT1 and Tie2 transcriptionally through ETS conserved binding sites on the promoters by interacting with ETS2. Elevated expression of √Ö¬í√É¬ÆNp73 promotes tumor progression by mediating angiogenesis and survival. Therapeutic targeting of downstream √Ö¬í√É¬ÆNp73 signaling pathways by rebastinib inhibits growth of established tumors and extends survival in preclinical models of glioblastoma.Conclusion:Aberrant expression of √Ö¬í√É¬ÆNp73 in GBM promotes tumor progression through autocrine and paracrine signaling dependent on Tie2 activation by ANGPT1. Disruption of this signaling by rebastinib improves tumor response to treatment in glioblastoma.

Ground Truth (GT):
In glioblastoma, √é¬îNp73 interacts with ETS2 to transcriptionally upregulate ANGPT1 and Tie2, promoting angiogenesis and survival in glioblastomas. This interaction enhances tumor progression through autocrine and paracrine signaling dependent on Tie2 activation by ANGPT1. Disrupting this signaling pathway with rebastinib, a small-molecule inhibitor, can inhibit tumor growth and extend survival in preclinical models of glioblastoma.

Answer:
The interaction between √é¬îNp73 and ETS2 proteins leads to the upregulation of ANGPT1 and Tie2, promoting angiogenesis and survival in glioblastomas. This interaction enhances tumor progression through autocrine and paracrine signaling dependent on Tie2 activation by ANGPT1. Disrupting this signaling pathway with rebastinib, a small-molecule inhibitor, can inhibit tumor growth and extend survival in preclinical models of glioblastoma.

Abstract:
Here, we show that the budding yeast proteins Ndc80p, Nuf2p, Spc24p and Spc25p interact at the kinetochore. Consistently, Ndc80p, Nuf2p, Spc24p and Spc25p associate with centromere DNA in chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments, and SPC24 interacts genetically with MCM21 encoding a kinetochore component. Moreover, although conditional lethal spc24-2 and spc25-7 cells form a mitotic spindle, the kinetochores remain in the mother cell body and fail to segregate the chromosomes. Despite this defect in chromosome segregation, spc24-2 and spc25-7 cells do not arrest in metaphase in response to checkpoint control. Furthermore, spc24-2 cells showed a mitotic checkpoint defect when microtubules were depolymerized with nocodazole, indicating that Spc24p has a function in checkpoint control. Since Ndc80p, Nuf2p and Spc24p are conserved proteins, it is likely that similar complexes are part of the kinetochore in other organisms.

Ground Truth (GT):
MCM21 and SPC24, both kinetochore components, do not exhibit direct protein-protein interaction (PPI) based on available evidence, but their genetic interaction is critical for chromosome segregation and mitotic checkpoint control during mitosis. SPC24, part of the conserved Ndc80p-Nuf2p-Spc24p-Spc25p kinetochore complex that associates with centromere DNA (as shown by chromatin immunoprecipitation), cooperates with MCM21 to ensure proper kinetochore function. Conditional lethal spc24-2 mutants fail to segregate chromosomes, with kinetochores remaining in the mother cell body, and exhibit defective metaphase arrest in response to checkpoint control, particularly under microtubule depolymerization induced by nocodazole. These defects indicate that SPC24, in concert with MCM21, supports accurate chromosome segregation and mitotic checkpoint signaling, essential for mitotic progression.

Answer:
The interaction between MCM21 and SPC24, both kinetochore components, is crucial for proper chromosome segregation during mitosis. If this interaction is disrupted, kinetochores fail to segregate chromosomes, leading to a defect in mitotic progression. Additionally, Spc24p plays a role in the mitotic checkpoint control, ensuring proper response to microtubule depolymerization.
