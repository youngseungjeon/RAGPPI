Abstract:
Cdc48 (p97/VCP) is an AAA-ATPase molecular chaperone whose cellular functions are facilitated by its interaction with ubiquitin binding cofactors (e.g., Npl4-Ufd1 and Shp1). Several studies have shown that Saccharomyces cerevisiae Doa1 (Ufd3/Zzz4) and its mammalian homologue, PLAA, interact with Cdc48. However, the function of this interaction has not been determined, nor has a physiological link between these proteins been demonstrated. Herein, we demonstrate that Cdc48 interacts directly with the C-terminal PUL domain of Doa1. We find that Doa1 possesses a novel ubiquitin binding domain (we propose the name PFU domain, for PLAA family ubiquitin binding domain), which appears to be necessary for Doa1 function. Our data suggest that the PUL and PFU domains of Doa1 promote the formation of a Doa1-Cdc48-ubiquitin ternary complex, potentially allowing for the recruitment of ubiquitinated proteins to Cdc48. DOA1 and CDC48 mutations are epistatic, suggesting that their interaction is physiologically relevant. Lastly, we provide evidence of functional conservation within the PLAA family by showing that a human-yeast chimera binds to ubiquitin and complements doa1Delta phenotypes in yeast. Combined, our data suggest that Doa1 plays a physiological role as a ubiquitin binding cofactor of Cdc48 and that human PLAA may play an analogous role via its interaction with p97/VCP.

Ground Truth (GT):
The C-terminal PUL domain of Doa1 directly interacts with Cdc48, forming a Doa1-Cdc48-ubiquitin ternary complex. This interaction is facilitated by a novel ubiquitin binding domain in Doa1, which is necessary for its function. This complex formation allows for the recruitment of ubiquitinated proteins to Cdc48, suggesting a physiological role for Doa1 as a ubiquitin binding cofactor of Cdc48, which could potentially be exploited for therapeutic interventions.

Please assess the appropriateness of the answer.

Abstract:
The DEAD box protein Mss116p binds to the mitochondrial RNA polymerase RPO41, stabilizing it in a post-translocated state and enhancing its processivity. This interaction lowers the concentration of nucleotide substrate needed for the polymerase to escape pausing, thereby increasing the efficiency of mitochondrial transcription. Overexpression of either RPO41 or MSS116 can increase cell survival under stress conditions, suggesting a potential therapeutic role in enhancing cell survival.

Ground Truth (GT):
The SUMOylation of TUFT1 by TRIM27 enhances its oncogenic function, promoting the proliferation, migration, and invasion of gastric cancer cells by activating the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. The binding of TUFT1 to TRIM27 is crucial for this effect, and a decrease in this binding affinity significantly impairs the oncogenic effect of TUFT1. Additionally, SUMOylated TUFT1 directly activates mTOR by forming a complex with Rab GTPase activating protein 1, promoting the perinuclear accumulation of mTORC1 and furthering gastric cancer progression.

Abstract:
nmt1 in fission yeast is essential for thiamine biosynthesis and is regulated by the thi1 transcription factor. The thiamine-repressible nmt1 promoter is the most widely used promoter construct for gene expression studies in fission yeast. We show that in addition to thi1, thi5 also regulates the nmt1 promoter and its expression is undetectable in a thi1 thi5 double deletion. Thi5 over-expression relieves the repression of nmt1 by thiamine and rescues the thiamine auxotrophy in thi1 deletions. Thi5 may also work to regulate Thi1 activity. Sporulation defects and decreased conjugation were observed in a thi1 disruption; deleting thi5 did not affect conjugation, but resulted in decreased sensitivity to exogenous thiamine. The thi5 deletion is epistatic to thi1 with respect to the failure of the thi1 disruption to produce spores. Thi5 negatively regulates some stages of meiosis. Over-expressing Thi1 from its native promoter results in increased thiamine-insensitive conjugation in all genetic backgrounds, suggesting that Thi1 positively regulates meiosis and that thiamine inhibition of conjugation is a result of Thi1 repression. Thi5 and Thi1 work in the same pathway to positively regulate nmt1 promoter activity. In conjugation, Thi5 and Thi1 operate in different pathways to transcribe antagonists involved in the completion of meiosis.

Ground Truth (GT):
Thi1 and Thi5 work together to regulate the nmt1 promoter, which is essential for thiamine biosynthesis in fission yeast. Overexpression of Thi5 can relieve the repression of nmt1 by thiamine and rescue thiamine auxotrophy in thi1 deletions, suggesting a functional interplay between these two proteins. Additionally, Thi1 and Thi5 have distinct roles in meiosis, with Thi1 positively regulating meiosis and Thi5 negatively regulating certain stages, indicating a complex regulatory network in yeast reproduction.

Abstract:
Since copper (Cu) is essential in key physiological oxidation reactions, organisms have developed strategies for handling Cu while avoiding its potentially toxic effects. Among the tools that have evolved to cope with Cu is a network of Cu homeostasis factors such as Cu-transporting P-type ATPases that play a key role in transmembrane Cu transport. In this work we present the functional characterization of an Arabidopsis Cu-transporting P-type ATPase, denoted heavy metal ATPase 5 (HMA5), and its interaction with Arabidopsis metallochaperones. HMA5 is primarily expressed in roots, and is strongly and specifically induced by Cu in whole plants. We have identified and characterized plants carrying two independent T-DNA insertion alleles, hma5-1 and hma5-2. Both mutants are hypersensitive to Cu but not to other metals such as iron, zinc or cadmium. Interestingly, root tips from Cu-treated hma5 mutants exhibit a wave-like phenotype at early stages and later on main root growth completely arrests whereas lateral roots emerge near the crown. Accordingly, these lines accumulate Cu in roots to a greater extent than wild-type plants under Cu excess. Finally, yeast two-hybrid experiments demonstrate that the metal-binding domains of HMA5 interact with Arabidopsis ATX1-like Cu chaperones, and suggest a regulatory role for the plant-specific domain of the CCH Cu chaperone. Based on these findings, we propose a role for HMA5 in Cu compartmentalization and detoxification.

Ground Truth (GT):
The metal-binding domains of HMA5 interact with Arabidopsis ATX1-like Cu chaperones, and suggest a regulatory role for the plant-specific domain of the CCH Cu chaperone. This interaction helps HMA5 in Cu compartmentalization and detoxification.

Answer:
The interaction between HMA5 and CCH in Arabidopsis plants aids in the regulation of copper (Cu) levels. HMA5, a Cu-transporting P-type ATPase, binds with the CCH Cu chaperone, facilitating the transmembrane transport of Cu. This interaction helps in Cu compartmentalization and detoxification, preventing Cu toxicity and maintaining the plant's health.

Abstract:
Background:Glioblastoma (GBM) remains one of the least successfully treated cancers. It is essential to understand the basic biology of this lethal disease and investigate novel pharmacological targets to treat GBM. The aims of this study were to determine the biological consequences of elevated expression of √Ö¬í√É¬ÆNp73, an N-terminal truncated isoform of TP73, and to evaluate targeting of its downstream mediators, the angiopoietin 1 (ANGPT1)/tunica interna endothelial cell kinase 2 (Tie2) axis, by using a highly potent, orally available small-molecule inhibitor (rebastinib) in GBM.Methods:√Ö¬í√É¬ÆNp73 expression was assessed in glioma sphere cultures, xenograft glioblastoma tumors, and glioblastoma patients by western blot, quantitative reverse transcription PCR, and immunohistochemistry. Immunoprecipitation, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChiP) and sequential ChIP were performed to determine the interaction between √Ö¬í√É¬ÆNp73 and E26 transformation-specific (ETS) proto-oncogene 2 (ETS2) proteins. The oncogenic consequences of √Ö¬í√É¬ÆNp73 expression in glioblastomas were examined by in vitro and in vivo experiments, including orthotopic zebrafish and mouse intracranial-injection models. Effects of rebastinib on growth of established tumors and survival were examined in an intracranial-injection mouse model.Results:√Ö¬í√É¬ÆNp73 upregulates both ANGPT1 and Tie2 transcriptionally through ETS conserved binding sites on the promoters by interacting with ETS2. Elevated expression of √Ö¬í√É¬ÆNp73 promotes tumor progression by mediating angiogenesis and survival. Therapeutic targeting of downstream √Ö¬í√É¬ÆNp73 signaling pathways by rebastinib inhibits growth of established tumors and extends survival in preclinical models of glioblastoma.Conclusion:Aberrant expression of √Ö¬í√É¬ÆNp73 in GBM promotes tumor progression through autocrine and paracrine signaling dependent on Tie2 activation by ANGPT1. Disruption of this signaling by rebastinib improves tumor response to treatment in glioblastoma.

Ground Truth (GT):
In glioblastoma, √é¬îNp73 interacts with ETS2 to transcriptionally upregulate ANGPT1 and Tie2, promoting angiogenesis and survival in glioblastomas. This interaction enhances tumor progression through autocrine and paracrine signaling dependent on Tie2 activation by ANGPT1. Disrupting this signaling pathway with rebastinib, a small-molecule inhibitor, can inhibit tumor growth and extend survival in preclinical models of glioblastoma.

Answer:
The interaction between √é¬îNp73 and ETS2 proteins leads to the upregulation of ANGPT1 and Tie2, promoting angiogenesis and survival in glioblastomas. This interaction enhances tumor progression through autocrine and paracrine signaling dependent on Tie2 activation by ANGPT1. Disrupting this signaling pathway with rebastinib, a small-molecule inhibitor, can inhibit tumor growth and extend survival in preclinical models of glioblastoma.

Please assess the appropriateness of the answer.

Abstract:
Here, we show that the budding yeast proteins Ndc80p, Nuf2p, Spc24p and Spc25p interact at the kinetochore. Consistently, Ndc80p, Nuf2p, Spc24p and Spc25p associate with centromere DNA in chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments, and SPC24 interacts genetically with MCM21 encoding a kinetochore component. Moreover, although conditional lethal spc24-2 and spc25-7 cells form a mitotic spindle, the kinetochores remain in the mother cell body and fail to segregate the chromosomes. Despite this defect in chromosome segregation, spc24-2 and spc25-7 cells do not arrest in metaphase in response to checkpoint control. Furthermore, spc24-2 cells showed a mitotic checkpoint defect when microtubules were depolymerized with nocodazole, indicating that Spc24p has a function in checkpoint control. Since Ndc80p, Nuf2p and Spc24p are conserved proteins, it is likely that similar complexes are part of the kinetochore in other organisms.

Ground Truth (GT):
MCM21 and SPC24, both kinetochore components, do not exhibit direct protein-protein interaction (PPI) based on available evidence, but their genetic interaction is critical for chromosome segregation and mitotic checkpoint control during mitosis. SPC24, part of the conserved Ndc80p-Nuf2p-Spc24p-Spc25p kinetochore complex that associates with centromere DNA (as shown by chromatin immunoprecipitation), cooperates with MCM21 to ensure proper kinetochore function. Conditional lethal spc24-2 mutants fail to segregate chromosomes, with kinetochores remaining in the mother cell body, and exhibit defective metaphase arrest in response to checkpoint control, particularly under microtubule depolymerization induced by nocodazole. These defects indicate that SPC24, in concert with MCM21, supports accurate chromosome segregation and mitotic checkpoint signaling, essential for mitotic progression.

Answer:
The interaction between MCM21 and SPC24, both kinetochore components, is crucial for proper chromosome segregation during mitosis. If this interaction is disrupted, kinetochores fail to segregate chromosomes, leading to a defect in mitotic progression. Additionally, Spc24p plays a role in the mitotic checkpoint control, ensuring proper response to microtubule depolymerization.
