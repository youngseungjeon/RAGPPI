Abstract:
Understanding mechanisms of protective antibody recognition can inform vaccine and therapeutic strategies against SARS-CoV-2. We report a monoclonal antibody, 910-30, targeting the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding site for ACE2 as a member of a public antibody response encoded by IGHV3-53/IGHV3-66 genes. Sequence and structural analyses of 910-30 and related antibodies explore how class recognition features correlate with SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. Cryo-EM structures of 910-30 bound to the SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer reveal binding interactions and its ability to disassemble spike. Despite heavy-chain sequence similarity, biophysical analyses of IGHV3-53/3-66-encoded antibodies highlight the importance of native heavy:light pairings for ACE2-binding competition and SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. We develop paired heavy:light class sequence signatures and determine antibody precursor prevalence to be √¢¬Ä¬ö√É¬†√Ç¬∫1 in 44,000 human B cells, consistent with public antibody identification in several convalescent COVID-19 patients. These class signatures reveal genetic, structural, and functional immune features that are helpful in accelerating antibody-based medical interventions for SARS-CoV-2.

Answer:
The monoclonal antibody 910-30, encoded by IGHV3-53/IGHV3-66 genes, binds to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding site for ACE2, effectively neutralizing the virus. This interaction disrupts the assembly of the SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer, inhibiting the virus's ability to enter host cells. The importance of native heavy:light pairings in these antibodies highlights the role of specific genetic sequences in effective immune responses, potentially informing future therapeutic strategies against SARS-CoV-2.

Example: BRD4>ASXL1


According to the abstract, what biological, functional, or physical effects result from BRD4>ASXL1?
Please answer based on the length and format of the provided example.

Abstract:
Proper regulation of gene-expression relies on specific protein-protein interactions between a myriad of epigenetic regulators. As such, mutation of genes encoding epigenetic regulators often drive cancer and developmental disorders. Additional sex combs-like protein 1 (ASXL1) is a key example, where mutations frequently drive haematological cancers and can cause developmental disorders. It has been reported that nonsense mutations in ASXL1 promote an interaction with BRD4, another central epigenetic regulator. Here we provide a molecular mechanism for the BRD4-ASXL1 interaction, demonstrating that a motif near to common truncation breakpoints of ASXL1 contains an epitope that binds the ET domain within BRD4. Binding-studies show that this interaction is analogous to common ET-binding modes of BRD4-interactors, and that all three ASX-like protein orthologs (ASXL1-3) contain a functional ET domain-binding epitope. Crucially, we observe that BRD4-ASXL1 binding is markedly increased in the prevalent ASXL1Y591Xtruncation that maintains the BRD4-binding epitope, relative to full-length ASXL1 or truncated proteins that delete the epitope. Together, these results show that ASXL1 truncation enhances BRD4 recruitment to transcriptional complexes via its ET domain, which could misdirect regulatory activity of either BRD4 or ASXL1 and may inform potential therapeutic interventions.

Answer:
The interaction between BRD4 and ASXL1, particularly in the case of ASXL1 truncation mutations, enhances the recruitment of BRD4 to transcriptional complexes via its ET domain. This could potentially misdirect the regulatory activity of either BRD4 or ASXL1, leading to dysregulated gene expression. This dysregulation is implicated in the development of hematological cancers and developmental disorders, suggesting that targeting this interaction could have therapeutic potential.

Example: Ubx>M1BP


According to the abstract, what biological, functional, or physical effects result from Ubx>M1BP?
Please answer based on the length and format of the provided example.

Abstract:
In metazoans, the pausing of RNA polymerase II at the promoter (paused Pol II) has emerged as a widespread and conserved mechanism in the regulation of gene transcription. While critical in recruiting Pol II to the promoter, the role transcription factors play in transitioning paused Pol II into productive Pol II is, however, little known. By studying howDrosophilaHox transcription factors control transcription, we uncovered a molecular mechanism that increases productive transcription. We found that the Hox proteins AbdA and Ubx target gene promoters previously bound by the transcription pausing factor M1BP, containing paused Pol II and enriched with promoter-proximal Polycomb Group (PcG) proteins, yet lacking the classical H3K27me3 PcG signature. We found that AbdA binding to M1BP-regulated genes results in reduction in PcG binding, the release of paused Pol II, increases in promoter H3K4me3 histone marks and increased gene transcription. Linking transcription factors, PcG proteins and paused Pol II states, these data identify a two-step mechanism of Hox-driven transcription, with M1BP binding leading to Pol II recruitment followed by AbdA targeting, which results in a change in the chromatin landscape and enhanced transcription.

Answer:
The Hox proteins AbdA and Ubx bind to gene promoters already targeted by the transcription pausing factor M1BP. This interaction results in a reduction of Polycomb Group (PcG) protein binding, releasing paused Pol II and increasing H3K4me3 histone marks at the promoter, which ultimately enhances gene transcription. This two-step mechanism of Hox-driven transcription suggests a potential therapeutic target for regulating gene expression.

Example: cyb-3>cdk-1

Please answer based on the length and format of the provided example.

Abstract:
Mitotic cyclins in association with the Cdk1 protein kinase regulate progression through mitosis in all eukaryotes. Here, we address to what extent mitotic cyclins in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans provide overlapping functions or distinct biological activities. C. elegans expresses a single A-type cyclin (CYA-1), three typical B-type cyclins (CYB-1, CYB-2.1 and CYB-2.2), and one B3-subfamily member (CYB-3). While we observed clear redundancies between the cyb genes, cyb-1 and cyb-3 also contribute specific essential functions in meiosis and mitosis. CYB-1 and CYB-3 show similar temporal and spatial expression, both cyclins localize prominently to the nucleus, and both associate with CDK-1 and display histone H1 kinase activity in vitro. We demonstrate that inhibition of cyb-1 by RNAi interferes with chromosome congression and causes aneuploidy. In contrast, cyb-3(RNAi) embryos fail to initiate sister chromatid separation. Inhibition of both cyclins simultaneously results in a much earlier and more dramatic arrest. However, only the combination of cyb-1, cyb-3 and cyb-2.1/cyb-2.2 RNAi fully resembles cdk-1 inhibition. This combination of redundant and specific phenotypes supports that in vivo phosphorylation of certain Cdk targets can be achieved by multiple Cdk1/cyclin complexes, while phosphorylation of other targets requires a unique Cdk1/cyclin combination.

Answer:
CYB-1 and CYB-3 cyclins bind to and activate CDK-1, a protein kinase, which in turn phosphorylates various targets to regulate mitosis. Inhibition of CYB-1 disrupts chromosome congression, leading to aneuploidy, while inhibition of CYB-3 prevents initiation of sister chromatid separation. Simultaneous inhibition of both cyclins results in a more severe arrest, indicating that these cyclins have both overlapping and distinct roles in mitotic progression.

Example: SAS3>GCN5


According to the abstract, what biological, functional, or physical effects result from SAS3>GCN5?
Please answer based on the length and format of the provided example.

Abstract:
Longstanding observations suggest that acetylation and/or amino-terminal tail structure of histones H3 and H4 are critical for eukaryotic cells. For Saccharomyces cerevisiae, loss of a single H4-specific histone acetyltransferase (HAT), Esa1p, results in cell cycle defects and death. In contrast, although several yeast HAT complexes preferentially acetylate histone H3, the catalytic subunits of these complexes are not essential for viability. To resolve the apparent paradox between the significance of H3 versus H4 acetylation, we tested the hypothesis that H3 modification is essential, but is accomplished through combined activities of two enzymes. We observed that Sas3p and Gcn5p HAT complexes have overlapping patterns of acetylation. Simultaneous disruption of SAS3, the homolog of the MOZ leukemia gene, and GCN5, the hGCN5/PCAF homolog, is synthetically lethal due to loss of acetyltransferase activity. This key combination of activities is specific for these two HATs because neither is synthetically lethal with mutations of other MYST family or H3-specific acetyltransferases. Further, the combined loss of GCN5 and SAS3 functions results in an extensive, global loss of H3 acetylation and arrest in the G(2)/M phase of the cell cycle. The strikingly similar effect of loss of combined essential H3 HAT activities and the loss of a single essential H4 HAT underscores the fundamental biological significance of each of these chromatin-modifying activities.

Answer:
The simultaneous disruption of SAS3 and GCN5, two histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complexes, results in a loss of acetyltransferase activity, leading to a global loss of H3 acetylation. This loss of acetylation is synthetically lethal, causing cell death due to the arrest in the G(2)/M phase of the cell cycle. This underscores the fundamental biological significance of H3 and H4 acetylation in chromatin modification and cell cycle progression.

Example: Rab8>POSH

Please answer based on the length and format of the provided example.

Abstract:
Mutations in genes essential for protein homeostasis have been identified in frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients. Why mature neurons should be particularly sensitive to such perturbations is unclear. We identified mutations in Rab8 in a genetic screen for enhancement of an FTD phenotype associated with ESCRT-III dysfunction. Examination of Rab8 mutants or motor neurons expressing a mutant ESCRT-III subunit, CHMP2B(Intron5), at the Drosophila melanogaster neuromuscular junction synapse revealed synaptic overgrowth and endosomal dysfunction. Expression of Rab8 rescued overgrowth phenotypes generated by CHMP2B(Intron5). In Rab8 mutant synapses, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/activator protein-1 and TGF-√Ö¬í√¢¬â¬§ signaling were overactivated and acted synergistically to potentiate synaptic growth. We identify novel roles for endosomal JNK-scaffold POSH (Plenty-of-SH3s) and a JNK kinase kinase, TAK1, in regulating growth activation in Rab8 mutants. Our data uncover Rab8, POSH, and TAK1 as regulators of synaptic growth responses and point to recycling endosome as a key compartment for synaptic growth regulation during neurodegenerative processes.

Answer:
Mutations in Rab8 lead to synaptic overgrowth and endosomal dysfunction, with overactivation of JNK/AP-1 and TGF-√é¬≤ signaling pathways. The endosomal JNK-scaffold POSH and a JNK kinase kinase, TAK1, are identified as regulators of synaptic growth in Rab8 mutants. This suggests that Rab8, POSH, and TAK1 play crucial roles in maintaining synaptic growth balance and protein homeostasis, and their dysregulation may contribute to neurodegenerative processes such as frontotemporal dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
