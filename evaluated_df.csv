Set_29,"The Drosophila comatose (comt) gene, encoding dNSF1, interacts with the calcium channel alpha1-subunit gene, cacophony (cac), affecting synaptic vesicle priming for neurotransmitter release. Mutations in these genes modify temperature-sensitive paralysis in comt, indicating a role in synaptic transmission. Therefore, the interaction between dNSF1 and cacophony could potentially influence neuronal communication and behavior, which may have therapeutic implications for neurological disorders."
Set_30,"CYB-1 and CYB-3 cyclins bind to and activate CDK-1, a protein kinase, which in turn phosphorylates various targets to regulate mitosis. Inhibition of CYB-1 disrupts chromosome congression, leading to aneuploidy, while inhibition of CYB-3 prevents initiation of sister chromatid separation. Simultaneous inhibition of both cyclins results in a more severe arrest, indicating that these cyclins have both overlapping and distinct roles in mitotic progression."
Set_31,"The N-terminus of USP8, a deubiquitinating enzyme, interacts with CHMP1A, a protein involved in endosomal sorting of ubiquitinated receptors. This interaction is crucial for USP8's localization to endosomes. Without this interaction, USP8 cannot rescue its binding partner STAM from proteasomal degradation or reverse a block to epidermal growth factor receptor degradation, indicating that the USP8-CHMP1A interaction is critical for proper protein degradation and receptor signaling."
